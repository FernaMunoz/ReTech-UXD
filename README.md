## Description

At Universidad de La Frontera, many students have unused electronic devices that are still working, but do not have an adequate platform to donate or exchange them in a simple and safe way with other students who might need them.

This lack of an efficient connection channel limits the reuse of devices, generates unnecessary accumulation of electronic waste and misses opportunities for student solidarity.

In addition, there is little knowledge about the recycling points available in the city, which hinders the responsible management of this equipment. This situation highlights the need for a solution that facilitates responsible sharing, promotes environmental awareness and contributes to the circular economy within the university environment.

## Strategy

At this point we will start with the first step of the Elements of User Experience which is the Strategy plane. A Value Proposition Canvas was created to understand and design the value proposition for the problem we seek to solve, identifying the customer's needs and desires, as well as their pain points.

In this photo is the Value Proposition Canva based on how to donate electronic devices to be recycled.

## Scope

When defining the product strategy using the value proposition canvas, we must define the scope plane. In this plane describes the functional and content requirements of your product, as well as the user stories and scenarios that describe how users will interact with it. You also identify the users who would be interested in the product and create user flows, site maps and information architecture diagrams to show how your product will be structured and organized.

### UX Personas

In this section when defining the structure plan, we have to define the scope plane, starting with the creation of UX Personas to define the possible users that will be interested in people to donate functional electronic devices.

By creating Personas with different contexts where a person is required to donate a device, such as a user who needs it or wants to get rid of the accumulation of electronic devices.

[![UX Persona 3](Files/UX_Person_3.png)](Files/UX_Person_3.png)


### Customer Journey Map

Based on the creation of UX Personas we define the Customer Journey Map to identify what is wanted from the application to design.

### Benchmark

Benchmarking in UX Design allows you to validate designs according to project objectives, compare the product with competitors, and track potential results over time.

Based on the points identified in the previous section, a benchmark canvas was made to validate the objective of our project and to make comparisons with different competitors.

## Structure

The design and navigation of a product is defined in the structure plane, in the case of this project to design an application to donate or recycle electronic devices, it is necessary to know how the navigation of the application will be carried out.

In the Site Map shows how the navigation of the application works.

## Skeleton
The fourth plane, which is the skeleton, is where the graphic interface is designed, the navigation and how components such as buttons, text, images, etc. will be placed. Wireframes are a visual representation of what users will see and interact with in the application. The purpose of a wireframe is to visualize the concept of the project. 

In this case to make a design for an application to donate or recycle electronic devices. Designing the visualization of how this application will work, with its navigation and components. 

Below are the wireframes designed for the mobile application where you upload publications to donate and find recycling points for electronic devices, as well as talk to people interested in your publications and schedule a meeting point.

## Surface
Finally, there is the surface plane, where the actual interface that users will see and interact with is designed, as well as the content that the application will present.

With the design of the screens you can see the colors, components and operation of the application, shown below.
