## Description

The problem to be solved is the accumulation of electronic devices that people keep. Where most of them are still working or some reasons may be that the person bought another device or no longer uses the electronic device.  Such as cell phones, computers, chargers, etc. The solution we found is to find a new life for these electronic devices, for a person in need or to recycle the device in order to reuse its parts.

Through a mobile application, where the user will publish the electronic devices that are not used and locate recycling points that receive electronic devices that work. You publish your device and if a user is interested there will be a communication space to decide a meeting point and make the delivery.

## Strategy

At this point we will start with the first step of the Elements of User Experience which is the Strategy plane. A Value Proposition Canvas was created to understand and design the value proposition for the problem we seek to solve, identifying the customer's needs and desires, as well as their pain points.

In this photo is the Value Proposition Canva based on how to donate electronic devices to be recycled.

## Scope

When defining the product strategy using the value proposition canvas, we must define the scope plane. In this plane describes the functional and content requirements of your product, as well as the user stories and scenarios that describe how users will interact with it. You also identify the users who would be interested in the product and create user flows, site maps and information architecture diagrams to show how your product will be structured and organized.

### UX Personas

In this section when defining the structure plan, we have to define the scope plane, starting with the creation of UX Personas to define the possible users that will be interested in people to donate functional electronic devices.

By creating Personas with different contexts where a person is required to donate a device, such as a user who needs it or wants to get rid of the accumulation of electronic devices.

### Customer Journey Map

Based on the creation of UX Personas we define the Customer Journey Map to identify what is wanted from the application to design.

### Benchmark

Benchmarking in UX Design allows you to validate designs according to project objectives, compare the product with competitors, and track potential results over time.

Based on the points identified in the previous section, a benchmark canvas was made to validate the objective of our project and to make comparisons with different competitors.

## Structure

The design and navigation of a product is defined in the structure plane, in the case of this project to design an application to donate or recycle electronic devices, it is necessary to know how the navigation of the application will be carried out.

In the Site Map shows how the navigation of the application works.
