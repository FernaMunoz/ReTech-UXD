## Description

The problem to be solved is the accumulation of electronic devices that people keep. Where most of them are still working or some reasons may be that the person bought another device or no longer uses the electronic device.  Such as cell phones, computers, chargers, etc. The solution we found is to find a new life for these electronic devices, for a person in need or to recycle the device in order to reuse its parts.

Through a mobile application, where the user will publish the electronic devices that are not used and locate recycling points that receive electronic devices that work. publicas tu dispositivo y si un usuario esta interesado habra un espacio de comunicacion para decidir un punto de encuentro y hacer la entrega.

## Strategy

At this point we will start with the first step of the Elements of User Experience which is the Strategy plane. A Value Proposition Canvas was created to understand and design the value proposition for the problem we seek to solve, identifying the customer's needs and desires, as well as their pain points.

In this photo is the Value Proposition Canva based on how to donate electronic devices to be recycled.
